        <h2>Write for the web</h2>
        <p>
          This section refers to the audience as users since that is a more common term in the web community. To
          effectively communicate with your web users, you must use plain-language techniques to write web content. This
          section will explain the differences between print and web writing and how to create sites that work for your
          users.

        <p>
          People use the internet to easily find, understand, and use information to complete a task. Unlike print
          media, people do not read entire web pages. They scan instead. Nielsen and Morkes, in a famous 1997 study,
          found that 79 percent of their test users always scanned any new page they came across; only 16 percent read
          word-by-word.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even with more people using the web, the percent of content that is read on a website has not increased by
          much. Here are some facts to consider when writing web content:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In a 2008 study, based on analysis of 45,237 page views, Nielsen found that web users only read about 18% of
            whatâ€™s one page.
          </li>
          <li>As the number of words on a page goes up, the percentage read goes down.</li>
          <li>To get people to read half your words, you must limit your page to 110 words or fewer.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Since we know web users scan web pages, we need to learn what they look at. Users often scan pages in an F
          pattern focusing on the top left side of the page, headings, and the first few words of a sentence or bulleted
          list. On average, users only read the first two words on each line. Also, users can decide in as little as
          five seconds whether your site is useful to them. Here is an image of one of the eye tracking pages. The red
          shows where the user looked the most:
        </p>

    </main>

    <script type="module" src="./javascripts/main.js"></script>
